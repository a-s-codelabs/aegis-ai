simple, understandable code is better than clever code
write code that are direct and easy to understand
apply input validation and error handling

use best practices
when writing fn - create input and output types

comment only when necessary example why this code is needed
don't create docs unless specified

avoid unnecessary abstraction
avoid creating code and files unnecessarily, try to use created code
do only necessary changes
